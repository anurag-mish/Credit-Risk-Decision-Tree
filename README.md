# Credit Risk Prediction – Decision Tree Classifier (CIS 412)

This project uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict credit risk based on a variety of financial and personal attributes. Developed as part of Software Lab 2 in CIS 412 – Business Machine Learning.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored the `credit.csv` dataset for trends and missing values.
- Applied preprocessing techniques: encoding categorical variables and normalization.
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `scikit-learn` to predict binary outcomes.
- Evaluated model accuracy and visualized tree structure.
- Interpreted feature importance to understand key predictors of credit risk.
